Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Atmosfix handles information when you use the Atmosfix app (the "Service").

1. Information We Do Not Collect
Atmosfix does not collect or store personal data on our servers. We do not run analytics, tracking, or advertising identifiers.

2. Information Processed on Your Device
The Service processes the following data only on your device:
- Location data: Used to fetch local atmospheric pressure information if you grant permission.
- User content: Logs, notes, and preferences you enter in the app.
- Device data: Limited technical information needed to operate the app (e.g., app version).

3. Apple Services
To provide core features, Atmosfix uses Apple services:
- WeatherKit and MapKit: Location data is sent to Apple services to return pressure and place results.
- StoreKit: Subscription status is handled by Apple. We do not receive your payment details.
- iCloud (optional): If you enable iCloud Sync, your data is stored in your iCloud account and governed by Apple's policies.

4. How Information Is Used
- To provide pressure forecasts and alerts.
- To display and store your logs and preferences on your device.
- To sync logs across your devices if iCloud Sync is enabled.

5. Data Storage
- Your data is stored locally on your device.
- If you enable iCloud Sync, your data is stored in your iCloud account.
- Certain shared settings may be stored in an app group to support widgets and Apple Watch sync.

6. Sharing
We do not sell your personal data. Data is only shared with Apple services required to operate the app (WeatherKit, MapKit, StoreKit, iCloud).

7. Your Choices
- You can disable location access in system settings.
- You can enable or disable iCloud Sync in Settings.
- You can delete your data from within the app.
- You can manage notification preferences in the app.

8. Data Retention
We keep your data only as long as it remains on your device or in your iCloud account. You can delete your logs at any time.

9. Security
We use platform-provided protections (e.g., iOS/macOS security, iCloud security) to protect your data. No system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

10. Children's Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy in the Service.
